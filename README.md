# R-Project-EET-FEP
An analysis based on a multitude of factors such as age, whether someone is a parent, gender to determine their likelihood of being in education, employment and training one year after first episode psychosis.  


Evidence has suggested that finding education is more important than any mental health intervention. So, if we can correctly identify those with poor EET outcomes we can apply vocational interventions at an earlier stage.

We decide to consider 130 people with the following measurements :
- are they in EET initially
- gender
- age
- parent
- total score on the PANSS general physcopathology scale 
- total score on the PANSS positive scale
- total score on the PANSS negative scale
- are they in EET after one year

We then calculate a maximum likeihood estimator for the parameters using statistical methods and find a confidence interval for each parameter.
We then simulate more data and see if this makes a different to our confidence intervals for each parameter.

It can be observed that the model does suggest a possible statistical relationship between a higher positive scale PANSS score and reduced probabillity of being in EET after one year.
